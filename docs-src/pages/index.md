## About this group

### History
The [Synchronized Media for Publications Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sync-media-pub/) was formed to recommend the best way to synchronize media with document formats being developed by the
[Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/), in order to make publications accessible to people with different types of reading requirements.

### Present
The [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/) is now primarily focused on spec maintenance; however, the work here continues to be to explore and develop synchronization techniques compatible with publishing formats on the web, including [Audiobooks](https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/), [EPUB](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/), and standalone [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/).
