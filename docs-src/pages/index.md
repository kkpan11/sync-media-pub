title: SyncMedia Community Group Overview
---
This is an overview of work being done by the Synchronized Media for Publications Community Group.

* [Github repository](https://github.com/w3c/sync-media-pub)
* [Mailing list archives](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sync-media-pub/)


## Approaches

Three different approaches have been explored to synchronize narration with HTML text, and possibly more. Their names are unfortunately similar.

### [SyncLite (WebVTT-based)](synclite){.lookhere}

* Uses the browser's inbuilt cue synchronization capabilities
* Easy to implement a synchronized text highlight
* Works well for common use cases of audio narrated HTML documents

### [SyncMedia (SMIL-based)](smil)

* Expands EPUB's existing use of SMIL 
* Full implementation is challenging
* Could support many different mixed media scenarios

### [Sync Narration (JSON-based)](json)
* Uses custom JSON format for timing and media info
* Implementation feasibility similar to Media Overlays


## About this group

### History
The [Synchronized Media for Publications Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sync-media-pub/) was formed to recommend the best way to synchronize media with document formats being developed by the
[Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/), in order to make publications accessible to people with different types of reading requirements.

### Present
The [Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/) is now primarily focused on spec maintenance; however, the work here continues to be to explore and develop synchronization techniques compatible with publishing formats on the web, including [Audiobooks](https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/), [EPUB](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/), and standalone [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/).
