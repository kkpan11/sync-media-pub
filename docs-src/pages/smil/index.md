title: SMIL-based approach to synchronized media for publications
---

## SyncMedia approach

This approach defines a usage of SMIL plus extensions. This would be good for combining multiple non-destructive media references, e.g. portions of many audio files for one HTML document. This is completely declarative with no associated scripting. This also is suited to a "player" type of environment, where a SyncMedia-aware user agent is rendering the content. Implementation is more involved than the example above with WebVTT.
