## Convert existing content

A library has a lot of narrated talking book content. They want to convert it from DAISY and/or EPUB with Media Overlays to something more modern like WebVTT. They need to port over the SMIL-based audio clip timing information plus HTML document selectors.


## Produce content without IDs on every text element

A content producer does not want to destructively mark up their beautiful HTML document by putting ID values on every element that is to be synchronized. They wonder why they can't use CSS selectors instead.

## Play directly in a browser

Sam has a web browser and wants to use it to listen to a narrated document that is located at a URL. Sam does not want to install an app.

## Have multiple levels of highlighting

The book publisher wants a paragraph to have a pink background while it's playing, and each word in it should be green as it plays.

## Navigate by item

Sunny wants to listen to a poem and navigate by word, line, or stanza. As they navigate by any of those types of things, the audio and text highlight follow. 

## Control audio playback rate

Bertha is listening to important information in a language not native to her; she wants to slow the rate to improve her comprehension.

## Adjust visual properties

Gregor is near-sighted and needs to enlarge text in order to read it. He prefers that the audio playback and text highlight work seamlessly after he uses the browser text enlargement feature.
