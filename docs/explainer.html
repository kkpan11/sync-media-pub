            <p>
                The use case of reading with narration and synchronized
                highlight has long been a part of electronic publishing, and is
                already supported by existing standards (<a
                    href="https://daisy.org/activities/standards/daisy/"
                    >DAISY</a
                >,
                <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-mediaoverlays.html"
                    >EPUB Media Overlays</a
                >). Under the hood, these standards use
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL3/">SMIL</a> to synchronize
                an audio file with an
                <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML</a> file,
                by pairing timestamps with phrase IDs.

            <ul>
                <li>SMIL is seen as complicated and outdated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Its roots are from the web's early days, before HTML supported
                native audio and video; and the full SMIL language is indeed
                quite complex. However, the usage of SMIL in EPUB Media Overlays
                is minimal and, with a few more restrictions, could be
                translated into a more modern format and be more easily
                implemented.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Synchronized text and audio is expensive to produce.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Production of audio narrated text is a lot of work and hence not
                as common as standalone text or audio books. Now with more
                powerful speech and language processing tools, automated
                synchronization is becoming feasible. However, it's not fast
                enough to do on the client side (yet), so book producers are
                still going to have to create pre-synchronized contents. But
                advances in their own tools are going to make it easier for them
                to do this.

                The same user experience is achieved with a more modern approach
                that is easier to implement. This is what is described in
                <a href="sync-media-lite">SyncMediaLite</a>.

                    Today, the HTMLMediaElement has built-in cue
                    synchronization. When loaded with a series of TextTrackCues,
                    the MediaElement will automatically fire off cue events at
                    the right times, so unlike SMIL, it does not require
                    hand-coding a timing engine.

                <p>
                    The CSS Highlight API makes it easy to register highlights,
                    which are then available for styling as pseudo-elements.
                    There is then no need to add and remove class attributes
                    throughout the DOM.

                <p>
                    In EPUB Media Overlays, this is done with fragment
                    identifiers. By expanding this to include the use of
                    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-states/#selectors"
                        >selectors</a
                    >, we have a more flexible way to reference text, without
                    requiring IDs on all the text, and can even go to the
                    character level.

            <p>
                EPUB Media Overlays could be replaced with SyncMediaLite, with
                the following modifications:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Restrict: there can be one audio file per HTML document.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Restrict: the audio file must play in the correct order by
                    default.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Expand: allow additional selectors, not just fragment IDs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adapt: allow the EPUB package document's
                    <code>media-overlay</code> attribute to accept a list of
                    space-separated values
                </li>
            </ul>

                Media Overlays to SyncMediaLite.
