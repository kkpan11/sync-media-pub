            <p>
                A library has a lot of narrated talking book content. They want
                to convert it from DAISY and/or EPUB with Media Overlays to
                something more modern like WebVTT. They need to port over the
                SMIL-based audio clip timing information plus HTML document
                selectors.

                Produce content without IDs on every text element
            </h2>
            <p>
                A content producer does not want to destructively mark up their
                beautiful HTML document by putting ID values on every element
                that is to be synchronized. They wonder why they can't use CSS
                selectors instead.

                Sam has a web browser and wants to use it to listen to a
                narrated document that is located at a URL. Sam does not want to
                install an app.

            <h2 tabindex="-1">Have multiple levels of highlighting</h2>
            <p>
                The book publisher wants a paragraph to have a pink background
                while it's playing, and each word in it should be green as it
                plays.

            <p>
                Sunny wants to listen to a poem and navigate by word, line, or
                stanza. As they navigate by any of those types of things, the
                audio and text highlight follow.

                Bertha is listening to important information in a language not
                native to her; she wants to slow the rate to improve her
                comprehension.

                Gregor is near-sighted and needs to enlarge text in order to
                read it. He prefers that the audio playback and text highlight
                work seamlessly after he uses the browser text enlargement
                feature.
