            <p>
                There are hundreds of thousands of existing titles of
                comicbooks, graphic novels and other publications which
                storytelling techniques rely heavily on more or less complex
                page layout. Deconstructing such page designs to fit on smaller
                screens or adding accessibility features for such publications
                is very hard, and many times not feasible as entire pages are
                often rendered as single bitmap images.
            </p>
            <p>
                SyncMedia lets an author describe a narrative journey through an
                existing publication using standard fragment selectors such as
                Media Fragments, PDF selectors and EPUB CFIs. Each step in the
                SyncMedia timeline directs the SyncMedia Player to a specific
                area on the page using X and Y coordinates as well as a prefered
                zoom level. A clip mask can also be applied after the
                translation has been completed in order to isolate the page
                content for clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                SyncMedia further allows the author to add spoken narration to
                each step and by doing so add accessibility features such as
                adding alternate descriptions of the overall context, as
                specific dialog present in speech bubbles etc.

                A very common use case for synchronization of different types of
                media is in book subscription services. Users of these services
                often expect a &quot;seamless&quot; transition between the text
                rendition and audio renditions of the same book. This is a
                feature that is hard to develop and maintain since there are no
                standardized ways to express these synchronization points.
            </p>
            <p>
                SyncMedia offers a standardized way to add granular to
                relationships between equivalent content in different renditions
                of the same title. It uses existing selector formats such as
                EPUB CFIs and Media Fragments to link to resources and positions
                within the various formats.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to acting as a mapping between media formats its
                explicit linking between locations within the different formats
                also allow for parallell playback, analogous to the way that
                EPUB Media Overlays work.

            <p>
                Junko, an audiobook reader, wants to navigate a W3C Audiobook
                not only via chapter but also by sentence. In this example, the
                audiobook does not have any associated HTML text. But even when
                there is no text equivalent, SyncMedia has the ability to
                arrange audio segments in a timeline and a SyncMedia-aware
                player will allow moving through this timeline via segment. This
                book was produced so that these segments represent sentences,
                and so Junko can navigate the publication at the sentence level.

            <p>
                Olga, a content creator, wants to include background music in
                her narrated publication. She chooses SyncMedia because it
                allows her to isolate the background music on its own
                <code>sync:track</code> and also allows her to use different
                music for different chapters.

            <p>
                Sanjay starts reading a SyncMedia-enhanced publication that
                contains background music. He wants to mute the background music
                because he has an
                <a
                    href="https://www.inpp.org.uk/intervention-adults-children/help-by-diagnosis/auditory-processing-disorder/"

                >
                that makes the background music very distracting. His
                SyncMedia-aware player gives him independent control over each
                <code>sync:track</code> and allows him to mute the background
                music track but leave the narration track unaffected.

            <p>
                Casey starts reading a SyncMedia-enhanced comic book that
                includes sound effects in parallel with the narration. They
                would prefer to hear less of the sound effects and more of the
                narration. By using a SyncMedia-aware player, they are able to
                independently adjust the volume levels of the different types of
                audio, because the author of the comic book has used the
                <code>sync:track</code> feature of SyncMedia to place the sound
                effects audio on a different track than the narration audio.

                Francesca, who has low-vision, prefers to read with very large
                text and simultaneous audio narration. She purchases the
                SyncMedia-enhanced version of a book for these reasons. When she
                reads, they can enlarge the HTML-based text, which reflows
                naturally on whatever size of screen she's using; and with the
                addition of SyncMedia for narration, the book has audio segments
                associated with each sentence. Her SyncMedia-aware player not
                only gives her high-level navigation for moving between
                publication chapters, but also lets her move by sentence. The
                experience is seamless because the text and audio remain
                synchronized throughout.

                Olivia has been enjoying a SyncMedia-enhanced publication but

                Juan is listening to a narrated book while also reading the text
                on a screen. They read slowly and want to reduce the rate of the
                narration to match. Their SyncMedia-aware player lets them slow
                down the presentation to 50% and maintains the fidelity of the
                audio (e.g. pitch) as much as possible. The rate modification
                does not affect the synchronization aspect of the presentation:
                the text segments are still aligned with the audio segments,
                even at a different playback speed.

                David has a fixed layout book where the sequential progression
                through the main document is not defined by its DOM order but
                rather by its visual layout. He uses the SyncMedia file to
                describe the progression, and a SyncMedia-aware reading system
                has features allowing David's readers to move through the visual
                narrative accordingly.

                In this case, the concept of playback is actually limited to
                displaying spatial regions, one at a time, controlled by user
                interaction to move from one to the next.
